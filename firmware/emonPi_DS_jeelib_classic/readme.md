# emonPi_DS_jeelib_classic

The original emonPi firmware, this performs power measurement in short discreet snapshots ~300ms long per CT channel at 50Hz per 10s period. Compatible with the original jeelib classic radio format.

https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emonpi-firmware-build/12428/45

```
RAM:   [=====     ]  52.9% (used 1083 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [======    ]  60.3% (used 18526 bytes from 30720 bytes)
```

### V2.9.0 (16/01/18)

- Allow CT's to be plugged in after unit has powered up. CT input will read zero if no CT is connected.

```
Program:   17886 bytes (54.6% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)

Data:       1048 bytes (51.2% Full)
(.data + .bss + .noinit)
```

### V2.8.4 (21/12/17)

- Correct USA voltage for apparent power sampling to 120V. Only affects battery / DC USB 5V operation. Does not effect when powering unit via AC-AC adaptor.

```
Program:   17942 bytes (54.8% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)

Data:       1034 bytes (50.5% Full)
(.data + .bss + .noinit)
```

### V2.8.3 (07/04/17)

- Reduce min pulse width to 60ms


### V2.8.2 (07/04/17)

* Reduce min pulse width to 60ms

```
Program:   17892 bytes (54.6% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)
Data:       1022 bytes (49.9% Full)

```

### V2.8.1 (21/11/16)

* Reintroduces "quiet mode" feature as seen in the RFM2Pi firmwares to allow improved RF debugging.

Serial `1q` enables quiet mode (default) and `0q` removes quiet mode for a more verbose output including bad packets that have failed crc checks. In emonHub it can be set with `quiet = true` or `quiet = false` in the interfacer settings. [Pull request discussion](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/pull/34).

**Important Note:**
After this update a manual change will be required to emonhub.conf, copy and paste the following to override the node decoder for the emonPi node [[5]] in the Nodes section of emonhub.conf:
```
[[5]]
    nodename = emonPi
    firmware = emonPi_RFM69CW_RF12Demo_DiscreteSampling.ino
    hardware = emonpi
    [[[rx]]]
        names = power1,power2,power1_plus_power2,Vrms,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,pulseCount
        datacodes = h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, L
        scales = 1,1,1,0.01,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,1
