**New 16th Feb 2023:** This firmware provides higher accuracy continuous monitoring. Continuous monitoring means that the power readings are representative of the full 10s period that they represent rather than a short snapshot. Support for radio formats: JeeLib Native and **LowPowerLabs (recommended)**.
